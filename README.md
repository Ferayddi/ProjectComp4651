# ProjectComp4651

## Welcome!

For the comp4651 course, our team has created a web application with the goal of offering a method for gathering datasets! The user of the web application has two options: they can crawl Reddit or Google using a search query, or they can upload their own raw data, which is a text file.

They can then choose the data file they want to use and carry out three different kinds of analyses:

Word counting
Sentiment analysis
NER examination

The outcome of those analyses is sent to the user for download in text format in the server response.

The analysis portion of the programme has made use of Spark, which parallelizes activities using methods like RDDs and dataframes.
Our deliverable is in the forms of docker images, which will leverage the power of cloud computing when deployed to Kubernetes, since scaling and management would be automated.
